FlightOS
=========

### Let your ideas take flight with the easiest to use OS on Scratch, so you can focus more on doing it, and less on how to do it.
#### And now it's available off of Scratch as well

To run the `.sb3` file, download the Scratch app at [scratch.mit.edu/download](https://scratch.mit.edu/download/). The PowerPoint presentation can be run, even if you don't have PowerPoint.  
**Both projects are incomplete.**

###### This project is also found on Scratch at [scratch.mit.edu/projects/348363899](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/348363899/).
